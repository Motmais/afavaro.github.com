    <p>Semantic segmentation is a classification task in computer vision that assigns a class to each pixel
of an image, effectively segmenting the image into regions of interest. For example, the
<a name="camvid"><a href="http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/">Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database</a></a>
(CamVid) is a dataset that includes a collection of videos recorded from the perspective of a
driving car, with over 700 frames that have been labeled to assign one of 32 semantic classes (e.g.
pedestrian, bicyclist, road, etc.) to each pixel. This dataset can be used to train a model to
segment new scenes into those same classes.</p>

<em>Labeled frames from the CamVid dataset. Each color in the label images corresponds to a

<p>One application of semantic segmentation is the labeling of satellite imagery into classes based on
land use. The <a name="inria"><a href="https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/">Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset</a></a> is a collection
of aerial images covering several cities from around the world, ranging from densely populated areas
to alpine towns, accompanied by ground truth data for two semantic classes: “building” and “not
building”. In other words, the Inria dataset can be used to train a pixelwise classifier that can
identify human-made structures from satellite images.</p>

<p>Fast.ai covers semantic segmentation for the CamVid dataset in their <a name="fastai"><a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical
Deep Learning for Coders</a></a> course. After taking the course, I wanted to see if I could
apply what I’d learned by using the Fast.ai library and a pretrained ImageNet classifier to train a
model on the Inria dataset with competive performance. This post documents my work on the project,
including some techniques I learned for working with large format satellite imagery and
experimenting with custom model architectures using the Fast.ai library.</p>

<h2 id="the-inria-dataset">The Inria Dataset</h2>

<p>As described above, the Inria dataset is a collection of satellite images covering 10 different
cities around the world. Each image, or tile, is a 5000 by 5000 pixel color image that covers an
area of 2.25 km<sup>2</sup>, so the width of a single pixel corresponds to 0.3 m. Half of the images
are accompanied by ground truth data, which are single channel images of the same size where pixels
corresponding to the building class have value 255 and all others have value 0. These images are
used for model training and validation, while the unlabeled images are used as a test set. There is
no overlap in cities in the train and test sets; each subset contains 36 images from 5 different
cities for a total of 180 images. The authors of the dataset maintain a leaderboard for performance
over the test set according to the metrics described below. As suggested by the authors, I used the
first tile from each city in the training set for validation.</p>

<p>Given the size of the images relative to available GPU memory, each tile and its label was split up
into patches as a preprocessing step. I chose a patch size of 256 by 256 pixels, which allowed me to
use a batch size of 32 during training on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU. I used reflection padding to
enlarge the tiles so that they could be evenly split into patches. Given the importance of context
in identifying building pixels, I used larger, overlapping patches for the validation and test sets,
in a process that is described in more detail below.</p>

<p class="image-pad half-width"><img src="/assets/images/semseg/inria-patches.png" alt="Patches" /><br />
<em>Patches from one of the tiles in the Inria dataset. Notice the reflection padding in the
edge patches.</em></p>

<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>

<p>The evaluation metrics used in the Inria competetion are pixelwise accuracy and intersection over
union (IoU) of the building class. IoU is a common evaluation metric in both semantic segmentation
and object detection tasks that is defined as the size of the intersection between the predicted and
ground truth pixel areas or bounding boxes and the size of their union.</p>

<p class="image-pad"><img src="/assets/images/semseg/iou.png" alt="Intersection over Union" />
<em>Intersection over Union is defined as the area of overlap between two sets or areas divided by the
area of their union. Image courtesy of
<a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/07/intersection-over-union-iou-for-object-detection/">this</a>
blog post by Adrian Rosebrock.</em></p>

<p>You’ll notice from the competition leaderboard that the accuracy values are generally quite high:
all are over 93%. This is partially due to the class imbalance in the dataset. Approximately 15%
of the pixels in the training set belong to the building class, so a model that predicted “not
building” for all pixels would have an accuracy of around 85%. IoU for the building class, on the
other hand, effectively normalizes for the size of the building class to give a measurement of how
well the model actually identifies buildings. For that reason, I focused mainly on optimizing IoU over the
validation set.</p>

<p>For training I used cross entropy loss, which is the default for semantic segmentation in fastai. I
also experimented with soft dice loss, an alternative loss function originally introduced for
<a name="vnet"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04797.pdf">medical image segmentation</a></a> which, like IoU, normalizes for the
size of each class in the calculation. I expected this to give me a better IoU as it seemed to be
more directly optimizing the quantity of interest, but I was not able to beat the performance of a
model trained with cross entropy loss. I didn’t look into this in too much detail, but I suspect the
dynamics of training with soft dice loss were somehow making it harder for the model to converge to
a minimum that would generalize well.</p>

</div>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Calculation of soft dice loss. The scoring is repeated over all classes and averaged.</em></p>

<h2 id="validation-and-test">Validation and Test</h2>

<p>Given the importance of surrounding context in identifying building pixels, I used a patch size of
1024 by 1024 for the validation and test sets, with 50% overlap between each of the patches. The
overlap ensures that each pixel in the test tiles is contained in a patch with at least 25% of the
patch size of context in each direction (except for pixels near the tile edges). To produce a
prediction map for the tile, the predictions for all of the patches were stitched together and a
weighted combination was taken of overlapping pixels, with pixels near the patch edges downweighted.</p>

<p>I took this idea from the <a name="ictnet"><a href="https://www.theictlab.org/lp/2019ICTNet/">leading solution</a></a> on the Inria
leaderboard by Chatterjee and Poullis, but rather than downweighting pixels based on the distance to
the nearest edge as they suggest, I went with a slightly different approach. Intuitively it seems
like there is some relevant context area around each pixel, and that the weight given to a pixel
should be proportional to the ratio of its available context in the patch to the context area. In
practice this downweights pixels in the corner of each patch more than those along the center of an
edge. In my implementation I chose to specify this context area as a percentage of the overall patch
area and found empirically that using a value of 80% (i.e. start to downweight pixels with less than
80% of the entire patch area in context) gave the best performance over the validation set.</p>

<p class="image-pad half-width"><img src="/assets/images/semseg/patch-weighting.png" alt="Test patch weighting" /><br />
<em>Given a context area, here drawn with a dotted line, centered around each pixel, the pixel weight
is the proportion of that area contained in the patch. The size of the context area is specified as
a proportion of the patch size, in this example it is 50%.</em></p>

<p>Finally, to assign a predicted class to each pixel we have to apply a threshold to the score output
by the model. Here I used Scikit-learn to produce an ROC curve using all pixels in the validation
set for a range of thresholds, and derived the accuracy and IoU metrics at those thresholds using
the true and false positive rates as well as the counts of positive (building) and negative (not
building) samples. I chose the threshold that gave the highest IoU over the validation set.</p>

<h2 id="model-improvements">Model Improvements</h2>

<p>Fastai includes an implementation of the <a name="unet"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a></a> architecture for
semantic segmentation with a handful of optimizations and smart defaults. After getting to know the
dataset better and applying the techniques above to optimize the validation performance, I wanted to
see if I could improve on the default U-Net architecture for the Inria dataset. The constraints that
I gave myself, in the spirit of the Fast.ai philosophy, were to use a pretrained encoder and avoid
distributed training with expensive hardware (I ran all experiments on GCP with a single Nvidia
Tesla T4 GPU).</p>

<p class="image-pad"><img src="/assets/images/semseg/unet.png" alt="U-Net architecture" />
<em>U-Net architecture from the original paper by Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox. The left side of the
model is the encoder, while the right side is the decoder.</em></p>

<p>In their leading Inria paper, Chatterjee and Poullis describe a U-Net like model architecture
combining a couple ideas from other successful CNN architectures: dense blocks and squeeze and
excitation (SE) modules. SE modules were introduced in a <a name="senet"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf">2019 paper
</a></a> by Hu et al. for image classification and allow the network to model the
interdependencies between channels of convolutional features using spacially global information from
each channel. The modules output a scalar feature for each channel which is used to reweight the
feature maps of the block to which they are attached.</p>

<p class="image-pad"><img src="/assets/images/semseg/se-module.png" alt="Squeeze and excitation module" />
<em>Schema of the squeeze and excitation (SE) module compared to a regular ResNet module, as proposed
by Hu et al.</em></p>

<p>Although I was unable to find a pretrained encoder using the exact same architecture described by
Chatterjee and Poullis, I did find, in a <a name="timm"><a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">helpful repo</a></a> of PyTorch
image models, a pretrained SE-ResNet ImageNet classifier, an architecture proposed in the original
SE paper, along with an implementation for SE modules. All that remained was to add the SE modules
to the decoding path. Doing so with the fastai library required writing a custom model which
borrowed heavily from the built-in U-Net implementation but allowed me to attach SE modules to the
output of each block. Although this was only a small modification to the network architecture,
there were a few details to take care of to ensure compatibility with the fastai library,
including: wiring up the cross connections from the encoding to decoding path using PyTorch
hooks, ensuring that the “head” or last layer of the pretrained classifier was properly
detached to create the encoding path, and ensuring that the layers of the final model were
properly grouped to behave reasonably with fastai’s freezing and unfreezing behavior and
differential learning rates.</p>

<p>Adding the SE modules gave me a nice performance boost on the validation set, validating the
effectiveness that small architectural tweaks can have even without adding a large number of
parameters to the model. I also experimented with a DenseNet encoder (without SE modules) and dense
block decoder (both with and without SE modules), but found that the SE-ResNet based architecture
performed the best. I trained the model frozen (i.e. only updating the decoder weights) for 6 epochs
and, after reducing the learning rate, unfrozen for another 10. Each epoch took approximately 50
minutes to train on the Tesla T4. I submitted my test set results to the competition and scored an
overall IoU of 74.84, which put me in the top 25% of the leaderboard. Not bad for less than 14 hours
of training!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building a semantic segmentation model for satellite imagery was challenging primarily due to the
size of the input images. After learning how to break the images up and reassemble the model output,
however, I found that the fastai library makes it easy to get up and running with close to
state of the art performance on semantic segmentation tasks, by encouraging the use of
pretrained ImageNet models and providing an opinionated workflow for model development.
Modifying the library’s defaults was a little challenging at times (for example using a
different image size for the validation and test sets and needing to rewrite most of the
U-Net implementation), but, especially as somebody relatively new to deep learning, it was
useful to have a baseline that I knew was going to give me good performance and to be able to
iterate from there. This project gave me the opportunity and motivation to discover as
necessary the details required to improve performance on this particular problem, and I would
highly recommend using personal projects to deepen your own understanding of the Fast.ai
material.</p>
